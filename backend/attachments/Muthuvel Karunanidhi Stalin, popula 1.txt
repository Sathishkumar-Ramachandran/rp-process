Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, popularly known as Thalapathy Stalin, was born on March 1, 1953, as the third son of the famous artist M. Karunanidhi and his wife Dayalu. His siblings include Muthu, Alagiri, Selvi, Tamilarasu, and Kanimozhi. Interestingly, Stalin was named after the Russian President Joseph Stalin by his father, who was addressing a condolence meeting for the Soviet leader, who had passed away just four days before Stalin's birth.

M.K Stalin grew up in a household that was steeped in the Dravidian movement, and his father's political career had a significant influence on him. From a young age, Stalin was exposed to the principles of social justice, equality, and Tamil pride. He imbibed these values and went on to become a key leader of the Dravidian movement.

Today, M.K Stalin is a towering figure in Tamil Nadu politics, and he has held several important positions in the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party. He worked his way up the party ranks through sheer hard work and dedication, starting as an ordinary member and rising to become the president of the DMK.

M.K. Stalin was arrested under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) in 1976. MISA was a controversial law passed by the Indian government during the Emergency period (1975-1977), which gave the authorities wide-ranging powers to detain citizens without trial.

It is imperative to note that, DMK had been actively campaigning against the Emergency and the suspension of civil liberties, and M.K Stalin was a key member of the party's youth wing.

On June 30, 1976, M.K Stalin led a protest rally against the Emergency in the town of Thiruvallur, near Chennai. The rally was disrupted by the police, who used force to disperse the protesters. Stalin was arrested along with several other DMK leaders, including his father M. Karunanidhi. M.K Stalin was detained under MISA for over a year, during which time he was subjected to harsh conditions in prison. He was kept in solitary confinement for much of the time and was reportedly tortured by the authorities.

During his imprisonment, he faced physical abuse and was subjected to beatings. At one point, C. Chittibabu, a fellow DMK member died from injuries sustained during police torture while trying to protect him. Despite these challenging circumstances, M.K. Stalin was determined to continue his education and managed to write his final year BA exams while still in prison.

M.K Stalin's arrest and detention became a cause célèbre for the DMK and other opposition parties, who accused the government of using MISA to stifle dissent and crush political opposition. M.K Stalin was finally released from prison in 1977, after the Congress Party was defeated in the general election and the Emergency was lifted. His experience in prison had a profound impact on him and he later became a vocal advocate for human rights and civil liberties.

M.K Stalin's involvement in politics began in 1968 when he founded the DMK Youth Wing in Gopalapuram along with his friends. Starting from a humble barber shop, the Youth Wing quickly gained popularity and grew into a Statewide phenomenon under M.K Stalin's leadership. He served as the Secretary of the Youth Wing for more than four decades, from 1983 until 2018.

During the early stages of the Youth Wing, M.K Stalin and other members travelled across Tamil Nadu to mentor and train fellow youth in key areas of active politics at the grassroots level. His dedication and hard work helped the Youth Wing become a formidable force in Tamil Nadu politics. Despite facing challenges and setbacks along the way, M.K Stalin remained committed to his vision and worked tirelessly to strengthen the Youth Wing.

M.K. Stalin's legislative history began in 1989 when he was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from the Thousand Lights constituency in Chennai. He was elected again in 1996 assembly elections, from the Thousand Lights constituency. He was re-elected from Thousand Lights in 2001 and 2006. In 2011, he contested from the Kolathur constituency and was re-elected again from the same constituency in 2016 and won by a margin of over 40,000 votes. He served as the Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly from 2011 to 2016.

In the 2021 assembly elections, M.K. Stalin contested from Kolathur constituency again and won by a margin of over 75,000 votes. He was then sworn in as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu on May 7, 2021.

M.K. Stalin has served as an MLA for a total of seven terms and has represented two different constituencies in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.

M.K Stalin served as the first directly elected Mayor of Chennai in 1996. During his tenure, he implemented a pet project called Singara Chennai, which aimed to improve the infrastructure of the city. His efforts in modernizing the garbage disposal system and building flyovers to solve the congestion of the city earned him the title of Managara Thanthai, or father of the city.

M.K Stalin's focus on integrated development projects such as health, public construction, and schools also made a significant impact during his tenure. He ensured that the standard of Corporation Schools was on par with private schools and set up parks and fountains at major junctions. Additionally, he modernized the slaughterhouse at Perambur to avoid polluting the environment.

During his first term as mayor, nine major flyovers and 49 short bridges were built, with an additional 10 flyovers planned before the end of his term. The allocated budget for flyover construction was ₹95 crores, with 30% of the funds remaining unused when the flyovers were opened.

M.K Stalin's successes as mayor earned him a second term in 2001. However, the then Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa enacted the Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment) Act in 2002, which prevented individuals from holding two elected posts in the government. This law was applied retroactively to M.K Stalin's case as an elected MLA from Thousand Lights, leading to speculation that it was a move aimed at removing him as Chennai's mayor. However, the Madras High Court struck down the law, stating that legislative bodies were not prevented from making laws affecting the substantive rights of persons retrospectively. The court held that under the Madras City Municipal Corporation Act of 1919, a person cannot be mayor for two consecutive terms, though earlier mayors were not directly elected. Stalin did not appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.

Despite the controversy surrounding his removal as mayor, M.K Stalin's achievements in modernizing Chennai's infrastructure and improving the quality of life for its citizens remain a significant part of his legacy.

In 2006, the DMK party regained control of the state assembly, partially due to the efforts of M.K Stalin, who was subsequently appointed as the Minister for Rural Development and Local Administration in the Government of Tamil Nadu.

Throughout his term, M.K Stalin honed his administrative skills and played a crucial role in the proliferation of Women Self-Help Groups, establishing a staggering 1,75,493 of them across the state. Additionally, he oversaw the implementation of several comprehensive drinking water projects, including the Hogenakkal and Ramanathapuram water schemes. In recognition of his contributions, he was appointed treasurer of DMK in 2008.

In 2018, M.K Stalin's father, the iconic DMK leader M. Karunanidhi, passed away, leaving a void in the party's leadership. With his vast experience and strong leadership qualities, M.K Stalin was chosen as the president of the DMK, a position that he holds to this day. M.K Stalin became the President of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 2018, following the demise of his father and the former party President, M. Karunanidhi.

He has led several protests and agitations against the government, demanding accountability and action on a range of issues, including the Cauvery River water dispute and the recent Citizenship Amendment Act.

One of M.K Stalin's key initiatives as the DMK President has been the formation of the "Secular Progressive Alliance," which aims to bring together like-minded parties and organizations to work towards a more inclusive and equitable society.

In 2019, he led the alliance to a resounding victory in both the parliamentary and assembly by-elections in the state.

Despite being sworn in during the second wave of the pandemic, he immediately got to work and set up a war room to monitor the status of essential medical supplies such as beds, ambulances, and oxygen. His quick response and dedication to helping citizens in need were evident when he personally attended to an SOS call from a lady, spoke with her for 30 minutes, and arranged for her a bed at a hospital, donning a PPE suit and visiting COVID-19 patients in their wards against the advice of his colleagues at Government ESI Medical College Hospital.
